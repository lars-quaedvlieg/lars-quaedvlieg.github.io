<b>Research interests:</b> Foundation Models, Sequential Decision-Making, Multi-Task Learning.

Welcome to my personal website! I am pursuing an MSc in Data Science at [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/),
where I am a part-time **Research Assistant** at the **Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research** (previously I was at the [Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/)).
My current research revolves around *transformers* and *reinforcement learning*, with a focus on foundation models
for decision-making problems. Earlier this year, I did a research internship at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/), and prior to my master's degree, I completed a BSc in Data Science and Artificial 
Intelligence üéì at [Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/bachelor/data-science-and-artificial-intelligence).

During my bachelor's studies, I had the opportunity to delve into applied research in various areas. As an AI research 
intern at Aucos AG, I worked on projects involving *multi-camera multi-object tracking*, and *multi-agent systems*.

My primary research interests lie within the exciting fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a 
particular emphasis on reinforcement learning and multi-task learning. For more in-depth information about my work, feel
free to explore the [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

Additionally, I am committed to leveraging my skills and knowledge to create positive impact and make a difference in 
people's lives. I believe in the power of collaboration, innovation, and entrepreneurship to drive meaningful 
change. Through my involvement in various associations, hackathons, and initiatives, I have gained 
experience in addressing real-world challenges and contributing to sustainability efforts ‚ôª. I am excited about 
opportunities to further expand my horizons and contribute to projects that align with this ideology.

When I'm not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me skiing down slopes ‚õ∑, swimming in mountain lakes üèñÔ∏è
, exploring scenic hiking trails ü•æüèûÔ∏è, or playing field hockey üèë. 

Thank you for visiting my website! I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the bottom of this
page), whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
