<b>Research interests:</b> Foundation Models, Sequential Decision-Making, Multi-Task Learning, AI for Science.

I will be starting as a **Research Scientist intern** at [Meta (FAIR)](https://ai.meta.com/research/) in London from June onwards! Currently, I am wrapping 
up my MSc in Data Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), where I work as a [Research Assistant](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/research-scholars/) in the 
[Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/). I am also honored to be a recipient of the 
[EPFL Excellence Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/master-excellence-fellowships/). My ongoing research projects are centered around foundation models 
and reinforcement learning, specifically targeting **AI4Math** and **LLM Reasoning**.

Below, I have created an interactive timeline to share some of my experiences. I invite you to navigate through 
it and click on any activity that captures your interest for more information. For further details, please feel free to 
explore the [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

When I'm not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me skiing down slopes ‚õ∑, swimming in mountain lakes üèñÔ∏è,
exploring scenic hiking trails ü•æüèûÔ∏è, or playing field hockey üèë.
