<b>Research interests:</b> Foundation Models, Sequential Decision-Making, Multi-Task Learning, AI4Math.

Welcome to my personal website! I am currently pursuing an MSc in Data Science at the [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/), 
where I serve as a **[Research Scholar Assistant](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/research-scholars/)** in the [Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/). Additionally, I am honored to 
be a recipient of the **[EPFL Excellence Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/master-excellence-fellowships/)**. My ongoing research projects are centered around foundational models 
and reinforcement learning, specifically targeting **AI4Math** and **Sequential Decision-Making**. Earlier this year, 
I completed a research internship at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/).

I have had the opportunity to explore a variety of research areas and participate in numerous extracurricular 
activities. Below, I have created an interactive timeline to share some of these experiences. I invite you to navigate through 
it and click on any activity that captures your interest for more information. For further details, please feel free to 
explore the [publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

When I'm not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me skiing down slopes ‚õ∑, swimming in mountain lakes üèñÔ∏è,
exploring scenic hiking trails ü•æüèûÔ∏è, or playing field hockey üèë. 

Thank you for visiting my website! I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the icons below), 
whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
