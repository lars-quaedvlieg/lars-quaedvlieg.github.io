<b>Research interests:</b> Foundation Models, Sequential Decision-Making, Multi-Task Learning, AI4Mathematics

Welcome to my personal website! I am pursuing an MSc in Data Science at [√âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/data-science/),
where I am a **[Research Scholar Assistant](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/education/master/research-scholars/)** 
at the [Caglar Gulcehre Lab for AI Research](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/claire/). I am also a recipient of the **[EPFL Excellence Fellowship](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/master-excellence-fellowships/)**.
My current research projects revolve around foundation models and reinforcement learning, with a focus on **AI4Mathematics** 
and **Sequential Decision-Making**. Earlier this year, I did a research internship at [InstaDeep](https://www.instadeep.com/).

I've had the privilege of exploring diverse research areas and engaging in a multitude of extracurricular 
activities. I've created an interactive timeline below to share these experiences. Feel free to navigate through it 
and click on any activity that piques your interest to discover more! For more detail, feel free to explore the 
[publications](/publications/) and [projects](/projects/) pages!

When I'm not doing research or working on my projects, you can find me skiing down slopes ‚õ∑, swimming in mountain lakes üèñÔ∏è,
exploring scenic hiking trails ü•æüèûÔ∏è, or playing field hockey üèë. 

Thank you for visiting my website! I welcome collaboration and invite you to reach out (see the bottom of this page), 
whether you have ideas for impactful projects, opportunities for partnership, or simply want to connect!
